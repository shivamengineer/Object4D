### WARNING: This uses the Ohio State Components and uses data structures that are not in standard Java ###

With this new component, you first create objects, then with those objects, you can:
A) create a new key frame
   The user sets a position for each of the nodes for the object at a specific time or
B) get a key frame at a chosen time
   The user gets the information of the object at the chosen time, getting the projected
   position of the object if between two key frames
